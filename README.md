## Usage
This website uses a server and the application itself is hosted on heroku. The site uses routes to serve up different html pages and makes get or post requests depending on the interaction from the user. Once you click the begin button you must enter a note title and description before a save button appears.<br>

Once you hit the save button the note automatically appears on the left-hand side column.

## Challenges
One of the main issues with this project was connecting the backend to the front-end, ensureing the right path routes were being created and the right syntax was being used in the server.js file. Another issue was not having the port set correctly for deployment on heroku which caused errors in building the app at first. The last major challenge was writing the logic for functions that appended the new notes data to the database text file that held the notes information.
